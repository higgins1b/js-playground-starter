# js-playground-starter

This project is made to quickly set up a JavaScript environment to play around with some brand new library or framework. There is an easy `build` script to generate production version of your app as well.

This project comes from the awesome [PAWEL GRZYBEK](https://pawelgrzybek.com/). His original version can be found [here](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/JS-Playground).
